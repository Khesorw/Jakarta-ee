üèóÔ∏è Projects Overview
1. Authentication and Authorization
Developed role-based access control (RBAC) for efficient user authorization.
Incorporated best practices for token validation and session management.

2. RESTful APIs
Designed and implemented RESTful web services using Jakarta REST (JAX-RS).
Followed principles of REST to ensure scalability, simplicity, and statelessness.


3. React with REST Integration
Built a React frontend to consume RESTful APIs.
Created a dynamic user interface with responsive features.
Employed asynchronous communication with the backend using Axios and Fetch APIs.

4. User Database and Password Hashing
Developed a robust user database using Jakarta Persistence (JPA).
Ensured data integrity and security through encryption and validation techniques.

üß† What I‚Äôve Learned
Authentication & Authorization: Understanding the complexities of security and applying principles like token-based authentication.
RESTful APIs: Building scalable APIs that adhere to best practices and industry standards.
Frontend-Backend Integration: Bridging the gap between REST APIs and a modern frontend framework like React.
